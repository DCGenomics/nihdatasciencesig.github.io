Do you have massive amounts of data? Have you heard about deep learning and machine learning and would like to learn to utilize these approaches in your research? Join us for the CANDLE workshop to explore one of many ways high-performance computing can be used to tackle cancer research challenges and advance precision oncology.

The CANDLE workshop is a collaboration between the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Laboratories (Argonne, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge). The CANDLE workshop will help you “wrangle the big data tsunami” using deep learning and machine learning applied to cancer and related diseases to increase your avenues to scientific insight.
